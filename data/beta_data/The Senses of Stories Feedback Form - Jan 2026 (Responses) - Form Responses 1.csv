",Yes,,No,"I actually like the name, except that it doesn't apply to your research. 'Stories' engage & evoke senses in an utterly different way to orphan sentences. Surely you can see this? ",Yes,," I love the idea, but the methodology doesn't seem likely to give you useful reults yet.  The impact words/text has on me is far more complex than the tasks assume. Therefore classification is difficult. E.g. 'Concreteness' and 'abstractness' can be evoked simultaneously by even the simplest text, and a scale can't describe this complexity. A sentence could evoke 6 concrete as well as 7 abstract. They are not mutually exclusive.  ",Yes

I mean, I can imagine having an evocative paragraph or a stanza, but with a single line, I feel like most of my answers would end up below 4. Another point is that you're kind of assigning discrete classification for something that's more or less a spectrum. For instance, if a sentence brings about a feeling of urgency, or if it brings about a feeling of fondness, both would be classified as ""Inner bodily sensations"" but honestly, I wouldn't feel very comfortable with categorising both those emotions in one single box.  And the field guide discusses stuff like concreteness and all which I didn't find among the options?",Not sure

Only click a sense if it is at least weakly activated."" > I see then in categorizing you seemed to have resolved this by having a scale of 2 - 7 , perhaps just change the tutorial image. 

Grammatical errors : I am aware it's not part of the study, but a lot seem to have grammatical errors - even if extracts from existing text, either the AI extraction is not fully effective or the original texts are a bit off. I see Prof. Piper saying these are OCR typo's in comments - and users are being distracted by it by commenting in comments thread. Perhaps add in the tutorial to overlook grammatical errors and focus on sensory experience. 

New Idea : I'm finding a few examples where maybe a textbox would be nice, so I can describe to you in a single word what sensory experience I am having. No doubt there will be a huge variety, but if it does not fit a given category maybe have a button 'other' and see what the volunteers come up with? 

General : last one, I always find that as an interpreter new to a project, there is a learning curve where I don't know the full range of experiences. We set the range in our minds, and that range expands as more and more extreme cases are interpreted. That implies the first batch of interpretations are judged against a very small sample set in our memory - not sure what the solution would be here, maybe a brief trial for volunteers to experience and select their own interpretation of the full range of samples you have to offer? I would go as far as saying this should be a 'calibrating exercise' for us every time we log into a project - projects can have several subsets that are offered every time the user logs into a project, this establishes the full spectrum in their minds again. I'm finding the range in my mind to be between very weak and neutral - the richness of language is not coming through the texts, perhaps because I am a native english speaker. I am expecting ""sweeping green meadows flooded with sunlight, warm and hearty aromas spilling out of cafes, gentle pitter patter of rain drumming on the tin roof, a bitter sting that made my tongue retract."" I'm not sure if there is a way to 'crank up' the sensory parts I think more users would enter the extremes of the spectrum. For instance many scenes are simply describing character, object(s), background - I 'see' the scene but there is little depth to it based on the text alone (suspect this might be intentional). 

For this task we use a six point (2-7) rating scale to capture the diversity of sentence styles.
2 = ""very weakly,"" i.e. the sentence is only weakly evoking that sense.
4 = the neutral mid-point. Equivalent to ""sort-of"".
7 = ""strongly,"" i.e. all of the sentence components evoke that sense.I'm struggling to understand the scale - very weakly seems to be the same as 'sort of' , I think change this wording 'weakly, mildly, strongly' for 2, 4, 7

Field guide comments 

Seems to be a bit of a disconnect between tutorial and field guide, field guide makes use of new metrics 'imageability and concreteness' not mentioned in tutorial < I did the tutorial, continued to classify texts, then only later viewed field guide as I assumed it would be the same as the tutorial. The field guide has very good details that might be worth adding to the tutorial. 
""Example: “She nearly dropped her tea and saucer into her lap. Highly imageable — a reader can imagine the shock and tactile sensation of tea spilling, even if the event is hypothetical (see also Edge Cases: Hypotheticals, Dreams, and Memories)."" <<< I do not get this sensation when imaging the scene because the text alone doesn't describe these details - my imagination is confined to the text, unless you explicitly add in instructions you'd like users to fully imagine the scene and its consequences had they been present and involved in it directly. In that case the study of user response to text becomes void - it is a study of imagination now. Tricky one, but I do understand you have tried to limit richness of text to see what it illicits in readers, without explicitly spoon feeding them the imagined sensations. 

""About"" page comments

We ask you to rate sentences from literature in three ways (choose your preferred workflow or mix freely):
Imageability – How imageable is the sentence? I.e., how strongly does the sentence evoke a sensory experience of any kind?
Concreteness – How concrete or abstract is the sentence? Does it refer to tangible things or experiences, or more to ideas and concepts?
Senses – How strongly does the sentence evoke each of six specific senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste, and interoception (internal bodily sensations)?
Also a bit confused now, I'm assuming you're referring now to different stages of the project and now I am on 'senses' stage ? This might be more of a structural webpage optimization opportunity for Zooniverse website, allow projects to have different stage dropdown and description for each. Same for field guide, different stage nested list

Otherwise a fascinating project, best wishes going forwards, looking forward to being involved once fully up and running.
